# Linear Syringe System for Controlling Soft Robot Actuators

## General Info

This repository hosts code, PCB designs, and other results from my undergraduate independent research course. This research is supervised by Professor Chris Rogers at Tufts University.

The goal of the research is to develop a low-cost, modular pneumatic system that controls soft actuators using a linear actuator and a medical syringe. If time allows, I will also try to perform a well-rounded comparison between my new system and traditional controlling methods like [this one](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/book/control-board)

Scroll down for pictures, demos, and complete building instructions.

Questions? Email yufeng.wu@tufts.edu and I will try to get back to you ASAP. I would also love to hear feedback or suggestions on how I can improve the current system.

Note: This README is still under construction! I just wrapped up my spring semester and will try to have the complete building instruction ready in the next two weeks.
